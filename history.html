            Origin: The earliest buses were horse-drawn carriages used for public transport in the early 1800s.
            Notable Example: The first omnibus service began in Nantes, France, in 1823, spreading to London and New York.
            Impact: These vehicles made transportation accessible to a broader population, initiating the idea of shared travel.
            
            <h3 class="oleo-script-bold">Steam and Electric Buses (Late 19th Century):</h3>
            
            Invention: The introduction of steam-powered buses in the 1830s and electric trolleybuses in the 1880s revolutionized public transport.
            Urban Integration: Cities began designing dedicated routes for buses, laying the foundation for modern bus networks.
            20th Century: The Rise of Modern Buses
            Internal Combustion Engines (Early 1900s):
            
            Transition: Diesel and gasoline-powered buses replaced steam and electric models.
            Accessibility: Automobiles became more affordable, but buses remained the backbone of urban transport for many.
            Global Spread and Specialization:
            
            Intercity Buses: Companies like Greyhound in the U.S. popularized long-distance bus travel.
            School Buses: Dedicated buses for student transport became standardized in many countries, notably the iconic yellow school bus in the U.S.
            Public Transit: Cities around the world developed extensive bus networks for commuting.
            Cultural Influence:
            
            Media Representation: Buses became symbols in films, music, and literature, often representing communal experiences or social mobility.
            Subcultures: Buskers and street performers enriched the experience of bus stops and transit hubs.
            Bus Culture in the Modern Era
            Technological Innovations:
            
            Eco-Friendly Models: The introduction of electric and hybrid buses reflects environmental awareness.
            Smart Buses: GPS tracking, Wi-Fi, and digital ticketing have modernized the passenger experience.
            Global Variations:
            
            <h3 class="oleo-script-bold">Asia:</h3>
             Countries like India and Indonesia have vibrant and colorful bus cultures, often featuring decorated vehicles and lively bus stations.
            Africa: Shared minibuses, known by various names like matatus in Kenya or trotros in Ghana, play a crucial role in public transport.
            Western Countries: Double-decker buses in London and articulated buses in major cities are iconic.
            Social and Cultural Aspects:
            
            Community Spaces: Buses serve as venues for interaction among diverse social groups.
            Art and Advertising: Many buses are used as canvases for local art or mobile advertisements.
            Challenges and Future Directions
            Sustainability: Transitioning to fully electric bus fleets to combat climate change.
            Urban Development: Adapting to the needs of growing populations and urban sprawl.
            Cultural Significance: Preserving the unique characteristics of regional bus systems while embracing modernization.
            Bus culture has always been more than transportation—it's a reflection of societal needs, technological advancements, and cultural values.
